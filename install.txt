This document will explain how to install the GBEER standalone application.
Currently this is a work in porgress, since we are still making major changes
in the organization and some aspects of the porject.

Dependencies:
All installation information assumes ubuntu 

Biopython:
sudo apt-get python-biopython

This program uses clusatlw, though it will soon use clustal omega.
sudo apt-get clustalw (for clusatlw)
sudo apt-get clustalo (for clustal omega)

CD-HIT:
sudo apt-get cd-hit

BLAST:
sudo apt-get blast2

NCBI tools:
sudo apt-get ncbi-tools-bin

Levenshtein module for python:
sudo apt-get install python-levenshtein

matplotlib: I will have to get this bit sorted out
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
other ways to get, though i don't think they are enough for this project
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
-or-
sudo yum install python-matplotlib

git:
sudo apt-get git

install the repo:
change directory to wherever you want to run the script from. then,
git clone https://github.com/reamdc1/gbeer_standalone.git

Data:  With the project we have included a small dataset from proteobacteria. If you are
interested in using a larger dataset, it can ba found at 
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/
additionally, if you wish to download every fully sequenced bacterial genome, go here
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/all.gbk.tar.gz
